                <p>Features like higher frame rates and ray tracing make the PS5 feel truly new-gen (to console gamers at least), while the DualSense is an amazing controller that really enhances games when used well. If you can find one for sale, the game library is large enough now that a PS5 is an easy recommendation.</p>

            <p> The PS5 is a beast of a console and more exciting out of the box than the Xbox Series X. The controller is amazing, and with ray tracing, games like Marvel’s Spider-Man and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart look incredible. Support for the PlayStation VR 2 also opens up more doors that aren’t available with Xbox or Nintendo.</p>

            <p>The base PS4 is a fantastic games console with one of the best game libraries ever assembled. Its first-party lineup is far better than what the Xbox One S offers, with the likes of Uncharted 4, God of War and Marvels Spider-Man are all considered essential experiences. However, the impending PS5 ensures future support will not last long, so the PS4 should only be considered if you are determined to have a budget-friendly console right now</p>

            <p>I bought the PS3 alongside an XBox 360 and to be honest, the 360 blows the Playstation out of the water. The playstation is much slower and the graphics aren't near what they could be. Overall, I don't care for the Playstation 3 and I feel like it doesn't compare to it's rival, the Xbox 360.</p>

            <p>The PS4 Slim is also the most affordable option for PS4 home consoles, but there are certain compromises because of this. There’s no 4K resolution and no optical audio output, but you can work with these limitations, so the PS4 Slim offers a lot of bang for your buck. The compact size also means the console is quieter and uses less power. </p>
