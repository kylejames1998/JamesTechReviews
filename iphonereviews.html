            <p>The iPhone 14 Pro Max isn’t just the most powerful phone around. It’s a joy to use, thanks to the clever new Dynamic Island for displaying notifications and live activities. Apple’s largest Pro model also delivers fantastic cameras — including a new 48MP main shooter — an always-on display, compelling Action mode for video and excellent battery life. It’s pricey, but it’s also the best phone money can buy.</p>

            <p>The iPhone 13’s brighter display, longer battery life and powerful cameras make it the best iPhone for those on a budget. We wish it had faster charging and the iPhone 13 Pro’s adaptive 120Hz display, but you're not missing that much versus the iPhone 14.</p>

            <p>The iPhone 14 Pro is the best phone for under $1,000. It’s powerful, has amazing cameras, sports a beautiful display, and the notch is dead. It’s hard to think of anything truly wrong with this device and it’s perfect for people tired of giant handsets.</p>

            <p>The iPhone 12 Max has without a doubt been the worst smart phone I have owned to date. The battery doesn't last near as long as the specifications say it should last. The screen is also dim for my liking. Overall, for the price point, I would not recommend this phone to anyone.</p>

            <p>The iPhone 14 is the worst iPhone I've ever owned, and I've owned every one since they were invented. The battery life is awful, I maybe get 8 hours on a full charge. The screen is very fragile, I dropped it 1 foot to the ground and the screen shattered. Also, the camera seems to be great for videos but the photo quality is nothing like you would think a $1,000 phone would have. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this phone for purchase.</p>
